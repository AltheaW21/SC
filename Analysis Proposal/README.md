# Analysis Project Proposal

For my analysis project, I have prepared two possible pieces to analyze. The first is a Tara Rodgers piece that I found on her website after finding her on the class listening list. She has a SuperCollider piece called "Buttefly Effects" that generates sound with parameters defined by the life-cycle of a butterfly. The piece and code exerpt I will be analyzing can be found [here.](https://www.analogtara.net/butterfly-effects/) 

The second piece I've prepared to analyze if this one is not possible is based off of a Ligeti piece called Poeme Symphonique for 100 Metronomes. I love the idea of coding aleatoric music, as I did with Terry Riley's "In C" in Orca. I found this on a SuperCollider forum, and the code can be found [here.](https://sccode.org/1-5ir)
