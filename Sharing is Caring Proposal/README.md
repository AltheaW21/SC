# Sharing is Caring Proposal
I've been listening to a lot of Juilius Eastman this week, and was inspired to make an Eastman inspired SuperCollider project. What I want to do is start the piece with a repeating motific sequence, 2-5 notes long, using the scale modules, and sounding with a basic SinOsc synth. The rest of the piece will be modulating this sequence in different waves based off of whether or not certain conditions are met, or at the discretion of the performer of the piece. For example, I might have a module that puts the sequence in phase with itself, and when they match up again, this might launch the sequence transposed up a major third, so that the motif is in harmony with itself. 
The performance element of the piece will be what modules the performer chooses to start and when, but it should start and end with the original motif in repition.
